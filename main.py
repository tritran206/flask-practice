#### Modify "My Watchlist" so that you eliminate the need for the "crossoff" form in edit.html.
#### Now, next to every list item/movie listed in "My Watchlist" you should display a button that says "I Watched it!".
#### Clicking the button will result in a confirmation message that the movie has been watched.
#### So you'll need to add a form within the <li> tags of "My Watchlist"
#### Once this is done, delete the "crossoff" form in edit.html

# TODO:
#### Make a ratings.html template which lists all movies that have been crossed off.
#### It should have a header of <h2>Movies I Have Watched</h2>
#### Add a form for rating EACH list item/movie using a <select> dropdown with the options/values
#### in this list: ["How was it?", "*", "**", "***", "****", "*****"]
#### And with a button that says "Rate It!" to submit the user's rating.
#### Give this form the action of "/rating-confirmation" and the method of post.
